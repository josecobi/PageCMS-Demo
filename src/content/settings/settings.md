missionStatement: >
  The Fells Prospect Community Association (FPCA) represents the residents and
  businesses of the Fells Prospect neighborhood in Baltimore, Maryland. Our
  neighborhood encompasses the eastern portion of Upper Fells Point and the
  western tip of Canton, creating a unique community with a distinct identity
  and character.


  As a community association, we work to enhance the quality of life for
  everyone in Fells Prospect. We advocate for our neighborhood's interests,
  organize community events, support local businesses, maintain the beauty of
  our streets and public spaces, and foster connections among neighbors.


  FPCA serves as a voice for our community in discussions with the City of
  Baltimore and other organizations that impact our neighborhood. Through our
  various committees and volunteer efforts, we address issues ranging from
  public safety and transportation to beautification and community engagement.


  Whether you're a long-time resident or new to the neighborhood, we invite you
  to get involved with FPCA. Together, we can continue to make Fells Prospect a
  great place to live, work, and thrive.
