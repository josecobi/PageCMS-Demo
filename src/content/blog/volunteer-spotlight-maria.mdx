Every Tuesday and Thursday evening, Maria Rodriguez arrives at our Riverside Community Center with a warm smile and a backpack full of learning materials. For the past two years, she's been one of our most dedicated volunteer tutors, helping dozens of students improve their reading and math skills.

## From Beneficiary to Volunteer

Maria's connection to Hope Foundation began 15 years ago when she was a student in our after-school program herself.

"I struggled with reading as a child," Maria shares. "The tutors here didn't just teach me—they believed in me when I didn't believe in myself. That made all the difference."

After graduating from college with a degree in education, Maria knew exactly where she wanted to give back.

## Making a Difference, One Student at a Time

Maria typically works with 8-10 students each week, focusing on reading comprehension and math fundamentals. But her impact goes beyond academics.

### Her Approach

- **Building Relationships**: Maria takes time to know each student's interests and learning style
- **Celebrating Progress**: She tracks every achievement, no matter how small
- **Creating Safe Spaces**: Students feel comfortable making mistakes and asking questions
- **Encouraging Perseverance**: She shares her own learning journey to inspire resilience

## The Ripple Effect

This year, one of Maria's students, 10-year-old Jamal, improved his reading level by two grades in just six months. His mother shared:

> "Maria didn't just help my son with reading—she showed him that learning can be joyful. Now he asks to read every night before bed!"

## Maria's Advice for New Volunteers

"You don't need to be perfect or have all the answers," Maria explains. "You just need to care and show up consistently. Kids can tell when you genuinely believe in them."

She encourages anyone considering volunteering to take the leap:

"It's the best few hours of my week. Yes, I'm teaching, but I'm learning just as much from these amazing kids. They remind me why this work matters."
