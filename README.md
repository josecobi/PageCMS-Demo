## 📝 Content Management with PageCMS

### What is PageCMS?

PageCMS provides a user-friendly interface for managing website content without requiring technical knowledge. It's perfect for nonprofit staff who need to:

- Create and edit blog posts
- Add and update events
- Manage team member profiles
- Update contact information

### Managing Content

Content is managed through three collections:

#### 1. Blog Posts (`src/content/blog/`)

Create and edit blog posts with:
- Title and description
- Publish date and author
- Featured images
- Tags for categorization
- Rich text content (Markdown/MDX)
- Featured post designation

#### 2. Events (`src/content/events/`)

Manage events with:
- Event title and description
- Date, time, and location
- Featured images
- Registration links
- Past/upcoming status
- Detailed event information

#### 3. Team Members (`src/content/team/`)

Add team profiles with:
- Name and role
- Short bio and profile photo
- Contact information (email, LinkedIn)
- Display order
- Extended biography

### PageCMS Configuration

The `.pages.yml` file contains the complete PageCMS configuration. This file defines:
- Content collection structures
- Field types and validation
- Required vs optional fields
- Widget types for editing

## 🎨 Customization Guide

### Branding & Colors

Update the color scheme in your Tailwind configuration or by modifying the classes:

- **Primary Color**: Currently `blue-600` - used for CTAs, links, headers
- **Secondary Color**: Currently `orange-500` - used for accent CTAs
- **Neutral Colors**: Gray scale for text and backgrounds

### Organization Information

Update organization-specific content in:

1. **Footer Component** (`src/components/Footer.astro`)
   - Organization name
   - Address and contact info
   - Social media links
   - Tax ID number

2. **Homepage** (`src/pages/index.astro`)
   - Mission statement
   - Impact statistics
   - Hero text and CTAs

3. **About Page** (`src/pages/about.astro`)
   - Organization history
   - Mission and vision
   - Values and milestones

### Form Integrations

This demo uses placeholder forms. Integrate with your preferred service:

#### Contact Form
- **Current**: Formspree placeholder
- **Alternatives**: Netlify Forms, Google Forms, Typeform
- **Update**: `src/pages/contact.astro` (line with `action="https://formspree.io/..."`)

#### Newsletter Signup
- **Current**: Formspree placeholder
- **Alternatives**: Mailchimp, ConvertKit, SendGrid
- **Update**: `src/components/NewsletterForm.astro`

#### Donation Widget
- **Current**: Placeholder widget area
- **Alternatives**: Stripe, PayPal, Donorbox, Give WP
- **Update**: `src/pages/donate.astro` (donation widget section)

### Images

Replace placeholder images with your own:

1. **Blog Post Images**: Update `image` field in blog post frontmatter
2. **Event Images**: Update `image` field in event frontmatter
3. **Team Photos**: Update `image` field in team member frontmatter
4. **Logo**: Replace in `src/components/Header.astro`

## 🚀 Deployment

### Deploy to Netlify

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial setup"
   git push
   ```

2. **Connect to Netlify**
   - Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
   - Connect your Git repository
   - Netlify will auto-detect Astro settings

3. **Build Settings** (auto-configured)
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Your site will be live in minutes!

### Deploy to Vercel

1. **Push to GitHub** (same as above)

2. **Connect to Vercel**
   - Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "Add New Project"
   - Import your Git repository

3. **Configure** (auto-detected)
   - Framework: Astro
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Output directory: `dist`

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Done!

### Other Deployment Options

- **GitHub Pages**: See [Astro deployment docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/github/)
- **Cloudflare Pages**: See [Astro deployment docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/cloudflare/)
- **AWS Amplify**: See [Astro deployment docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/aws/)



 ### Accessing PageCMS

  ## PageCMS is accessed through their web platform, not directly on your Netlify site:

  1. Go to https://pagescms.org
  2. Sign in with GitHub
    - Click "Sign in with GitHub"
    - Authorize PagesCMS to access your repositories
  3. Select your repository
    - Choose your nonprofit-demo repository (or whatever you named it)
    - PagesCMS will detect the .pages.yml configuration file
  4. Start editing content
    - You'll see three content collections:
        - Blog Posts - Create/edit blog posts
      - Events - Manage events
      - Team Members - Update team profiles
      - Media - Upload images to public/images

  ## How it works

  PageCMS connects directly to your GitHub repository and commits changes when you save content. Since your Netlify site is connected to your GitHub repo:

  1. You edit content in PagesCMS
  2. PagesCMS commits the changes to GitHub
  3. Netlify detects the commit and automatically rebuilds/deploys your site
  4. Your changes go live in a few minutes

  No additional setup is needed on Netlify - it all works through GitHub integration!
  
## 📊 Performance Optimization

This site is built for exceptional performance:

- **Static Site Generation**: All pages pre-rendered at build time
- **Minimal JavaScript**: Astro ships zero JS by default
- **Optimized Images**: Use Astro's Image component for automatic optimization
- **Tailwind CSS**: Only ships styles actually used
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic per-page optimization

### Lighthouse Scores

Target scores (can achieve 95-100 across all metrics):
- Performance: 95-100
- Accessibility: 95-100
- Best Practices: 95-100
- SEO: 95-100

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

- All forms use HTTPS
- No sensitive data stored in frontend code
- Environment variables for API keys (use `.env` file)
- Regular dependency updates via `npm update`

## 🆘 Support & Documentation

### Resources

- [Astro Documentation](https://docs.astro.build)
- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)
- [PageCMS Documentation](https://pagescms.org/docs)

### Common Issues

**Build Fails**
- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check that all content files have valid frontmatter
- Ensure dates are in correct format (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Styling Issues**
- Clear browser cache
- Run `npm run build` to rebuild Tailwind CSS
- Check for typos in class names

**Content Not Updating**
- Restart dev server (`npm run dev`)
- Clear Astro cache: `rm -rf .astro`
- Rebuild: `npm run build`
